# Module 4 - Clustering

## Overview

Module 4 will continue with basic machine learning algorithms.
The focus will be on clustering models.
The modules will cover couple of cross-cutting concepts, including distance norms, and k-means clustering.

## M4L1 - Introduction to Clustering

## M4L2 - Distance Norms

## M4L3 - K-Means Clustering

## M4L4 - Practical Details for K-Means
