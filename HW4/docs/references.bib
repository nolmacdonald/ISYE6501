Methods for series with no trend, or additive or multiplicative trend are examined. Similarly, the methods cover non-seasonal, and seasonal series with additive or multiplicative error structures. The paper is a reprinted version of the 1957 report to the Office of Naval Research (ONR 52) and is being published here to provide greater accessibility.},
